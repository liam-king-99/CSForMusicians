    "Python provides some functions to users, sometimes called *built-in* functions. One very common built-in function is the *print* function. We've already seen this one in the previous chapters. The print function can take in up to 4 parameters, but we will just focus on the case where there is only 1. The function simply prints out whatever was provided to it. We will use this frequently to check values in variables."
